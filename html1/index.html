            <pre class="description">Emeagwali was born in Akure, Nigeria on 23 August 1954.[4] His early schooling was suspended in 
1967 as a result of the Nigerian Civil War. At 13 years, he served in the Biafran army. 
After the war he completed high-school equivalence through self-study.
He is married to Dale Brown Emeagwali, a noted African-American microbiologist.[5]

            <pre class="description">
He traveled to the United States to study under a scholarship following completion of a 
correspondence course at the University of London. He received a bachelor's degree in 
mathematics from Oregon State University in 1977. He later moved to Washington DC, receiving 
in 1986 a master's degree from George Washington University in ocean and marine engineering, 
and a second master's in applied mathematics from the University of Maryland. Next magazine 
suggested that Emeagwali claimed to have further degrees.[6][7] During this time, he worked as a 
civil engineer at the Bureau of Land Reclamation in Wyoming.

            <div style="font-size: 24px" class="subtitle"><b>Court case and the denial of degree</b></div>
            <pre class="description">Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan from 1987 through 1991. 
His thesis was not accepted by a committee of internal and external examiners and thus he was 
not awarded the degree. Emeagwali filed a court challenge, stating that the decision was a 
violation of his civil rights and that the university had discriminated against him in several ways 
because of his race. The court challenge was dismissed, as was an appeal to the Michigan state 
Court of Appeals.[8]

            <pre class="description">Emeagwali received the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize for an application of the CM-2 massively-parallel 
computer. The application used computational fluid dynamics for oil-reservoir modeling. He 
received a prize in "price/performance" category, with a performance figure of about 400 
Mflops/$1M.[15] The winner in the "performance" category, was also the winner of the 
Price/performance category, but unable to receive two prizes. Mobil Research and Thinking 
Machines, used the CM-2 for seismic data processing and achieved the higher ratio of 500 
Mflops/$1M. The judges decided on one award per entry.[3][2] His method involved each 
microprocessor communicating with six neighbors.[10]

Emeagwali's simulation was the first program to apply a pseudo-time approach to reservoir modeling.[1]</p>
